## Description
WatchVault is a web application I made to help users keep track of the movies and TV shows that they watch. I wasn't happy with existing solutions, mostly because I wanted to have the ability to export and hold on to all of my data. This was my first major personal project, and I'm very proud of how it turned out. It gave me the opportunity to learn about React, hosting a website on a VPS, and how domain name registration works. It also taught me a lot about design and how to make a website responsive on mobile layouts. The project is practically complete, save for some features that would have required me to spend more money (like email verification and password reset requests).

## Features
- **Collections** - Organize media into collections. Media within collections can be ranked based on your preferences.
- **Rating and Reviewing** - Quickly rate and review the media you watch.
- **Export Data** - Simple interface to export all of your saved data so that you can hold onto it.
